Installing Git on a local machine is a straightforward process. Below are general guidelines for installing Git on different operating systems:

Windows:
Git Bash:

Download the Git for Windows installer from the official website: Git for Windows.
Run the downloaded installer.
Follow the installation wizard, selecting the default options unless you have specific preferences.
Choose the appropriate line ending conversion (Windows-style or Unix-style) based on your needs.
Select the default editor (usually Vim or Nano) for commit messages.
Complete the installation.
Git GUI:

If you prefer a graphical user interface (GUI), you can also install Git GUI during the installation process. It provides a visual representation of Git repositories.
Verify Installation:

Open a command prompt or Git Bash and type git --version to verify that Git has been installed successfully.
